We identify the diverse relationship between the time con-sumption breakdown across the system pipeline and thethree delay metrics in live 360° video streaming. 
We build an open research prototypeZeususing publiclyavailable hardware and software to enable task-level delaymeasurement. The methodology for buildingZeuscan beutilized in future 360° video research.
We leverageZeusto perform a comprehensive measurementstudy to dissect the time consumption in live 360°videostreaming and understand how each task affects differentdelay metrics.
We perform a comparison ofZeusagainst a commerciallive 360°video streaming system built on Ricoh Theta Vand YouTube and validate that our measurement results arerepresentative of real world systems
